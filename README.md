# scubot
Bot for /r/scuba Discord, and more!

## Dependencies
- Python 3.5+
- discord.py
- tinydb
- Dependencies of modules installed

## Usage
Before starting the bot up, make sure to set up a bot account first! You can do that in the Developer section on Discord's website. Bots using a user account are against Discord's Terms of Service!

Once you have that, take your bot account's Token and put it into a file named `token` in the same directory as `bot.py`.

Included are a few simple modules that are considered to be core functionality for a bot. If you want to make your own, [read more about modules here](modules_old/aboutmodules.md).

## To-do list
- [x] Rewrite core bot to v1.0
- [ ] Implement CI
- [x] Rewrite commonly-used and core modules to Cogs
- [ ] Rewrite documentation
- [ ] ??? profit
